        <h1>Brief About OPERATION SINDOOR</h1>
        
        <p>Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, 2025, targeting nine locations in Pakistani territories. No civilians were killed in this operation. The operation was initiated in response to terrorist attacks on Pahalgam that resulted in the deaths of 26 Indian citizens. The mission's objective was to destroy all terror camps in Pakistan and PoJK (Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir).</p>

        <h3>What Triggered Operation Sindoor?</h3>
        <p>The operation was launched in direct response to a brutal terrorist attack on Pahalgam, which left many civilians dead.</p>
        
        <p>Target locations included:</p>
        <div class="location-list">
            1) Muzaffarabad</br>
            2) Bagh</br>
            3) Kotli</br>
            4) Gulpur</br>
            5) Bhimber</br>

            9) Bahawalpur</br>
        </div>
        <p>These locations contained terrorist camps that were targeted by Indian airstrikes.</p>

        <h3>Why Did India Strike?</h3>
        <p>Delhi stated in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both PoK and Pakistan. The government emphasized these were "terrorist-infrastructure" locations where attacks were planned, and stressed that no Pakistani military targets were hit.</p>
        
        <p>Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV that the strikes hit civilian areas, denying India's claim of targeting terrorist camps. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later stated six locations had been hit.</p>

        <h3>Why Did India Launch the Attack?</h3>
        <p>The strikes followed weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbors after the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam. This was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack since India revoked Article 370 in 2019.</p>
        
        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to hunt the suspects "till the ends of the Earth," promising severe punishment for those responsible. In the subsequent weeks, both nations took tit-for-tat measures including expelling diplomats and closing border crossings.</p>

        <h3>Exposing Pakistan's Air Defense Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>Indian forces, including Rafale jets armed with SCALP missiles and HAMMER bombs, executed the strikes with pinpoint accuracy. The 23-minute mission exposed significant gaps in Pakistan's air defense network, which was bypassed or neutralized without any Indian assets lost.</p>

        <h3>What is the SCALP Missile?</h3>
        <p>The Indian Air Force used advanced systems like SCALP Cruise Missiles in Operation Sindoor.</p>
        <p><strong>SCALP Cruise Missile:</strong> Stands for "Storm Shadow," a long-range, air-launched cruise missile used for deep, precision strikes against high-value, fixed targets.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturer: MBDA, a European defense firm</li>
            <li>Launch Platform: Typically deployed from Rafale fighter jets</li>
            <li>Combat History: Used in operations in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What are HAMMER Bombs?</h3>
        <p>The HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) missile was used to engage medium-range precision targets.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilizes INS/GPS, Laser, and infrared guidance systems</li>
            <li>Capable of highly accurate strikes against both stationary and moving targets</li>
            <li>Effective in challenging weather conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Past Military Operations by India Against Pakistan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operation Riddle (1965 Indo-Pak War):</strong> India's response to Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar and Grand Slam.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation Ablaze (1965 Indo-Pak War):</strong> Pre-emptive mobilization by the Indian Army in April 1965.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation Cactus Lily (1971 Indo-Pak War):</strong> Air assault operation during the Bangladesh Liberation War.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation Safed Sagar (1999 Kargil conflict):</strong> IAF airstrikes to dislodge Pakistani troops from Indian positions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Operation in Motion â€“ 88 Hours That Shook the Valley</h3>
        <p>In the predawn silence of May 7, 2025, the Indian Air Force began its most ambitious air campaign in decades. A fleet comprising Rafale fighters, Mirage 2000s, and Sukhoi-30MKIs departed from strategically positioned airbases.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Targets Included:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bahawalpur: A known Jaish-e-Mohammed stronghold</li>
            <li>Muridke: Lashkar-e-Taiba's ideological and operational center</li>
            <li>Kotli: Arms and training depot for cross-border infiltration</li>
            <li>Skardu: Logistics hub for state-sponsored terror outfits</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The operation featured coordinated strikes using SCALP cruise missiles, Spice 2000 bombs, and BrahMos, synchronized with cyber operations that disrupted communication networks. Operation Sindoor represented a revolutionary approach combining air, cyber, and ground assets with unprecedented coordination.</p>
