        <h1>Phase 1: Infiltration</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Date:</strong> May 6, 2025<br>
            <strong>Operational Code Name:</strong> Operation Sindoor - Phase I<br>
            <strong>Mission Type:</strong> Covert Reconnaissance and Digital Penetration<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            At precisely 0100 hours on May 6, 2025, Operation Sindoor's Phase 1 was set in motion under the dense shroud of nightfall. 
            Elite special forces from the <strong>Para (SF)</strong> and <strong>MARCOS</strong> units executed a meticulously coordinated 
            HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute drop, inserting themselves across nine pre-determined high-risk sectors 
            beyond the Line of Control (LoC). The objective: establish concealed forward observation posts to monitor enemy movements 
            and prepare the battlefield for precision engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Simultaneously, highly trained cyber warfare operatives of the <strong>Defense Cyber Agency</strong> began 
            non-kinetic electronic infiltration operations. Penetrating deeply into adversarial communication networks, 
            they commenced a silent but potent extraction of real-time data flows and command hierarchy intelligence. 
            This digital groundwork ensured a comprehensive operational picture for commanders at <strong>Northern Command HQ</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Insertion & Reconnaissance</h2>
        <p>
            The reconnaissance teams employed cutting-edge stealth technologies, including radar-absorbent materials, 
            thermal-camouflage netting, and frequency-hopping encrypted radios. Over a grueling 36-hour window, these 
            operatives conducted high-risk terrain surveillance, mapping enemy defenses, and identifying high-value targets 
            for precision airstrikes. Every target was manually laser-designated to ensure pinpoint accuracy with minimal 
            collateral impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            Critical to mission success was the real-time verification of civilian non-presence within strike radii. The teams 
            employed micro-drone surveillance and heat signature scanners to validate their findings. This moral adherence was 
            upheld even under the threat of compromise.
        </p>

        <h2>Cyber Operations</h2>
        <p>
            While boots were on the ground, a digital front was unfolding in cyberspace. Operatives of the 
            <strong>50th Signal Brigade</strong> orchestrated a silent incursion into enemy digital infrastructure. Malware payloads 
            were seeded, establishing backdoor channels and siphoning classified command-and-control data to Indian military servers. 
            Contingency cyber-sabotage programs were staged, awaiting remote activation should conventional operations require digital disruption.
        </p>

        <div class="phase-details">
            <h2>Key Elements of Phase 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>12 Covert Recon Teams</strong> deployed to strategic vantage points across the LoC</li>
                <li><strong>HALO Insertion</strong> under full electronic silence protocols</li>
                <li><strong>Cyber Ops by 50th Signal Brigade</strong> with real-time comms intercepts</li>
                <li><strong>All High-Value Targets (HVTs)</strong> laser-designated by H-hour minus 12</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Exfiltration Corridors</strong> mapped and coordinated via satellite link</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance)</strong> uplink to HQ</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            By H-hour, Northern Command had full-spectrum visibility over all intended strike zones, allowing Phase 2 to commence 
            with optimal precision and timing. No casualties were sustained during infiltration. Civilian impact remained at 
            <em>zero</em>, adhering strictly to the Rules of Engagement (RoE).
