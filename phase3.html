        <h2>Phase 3: Extraction & Exfiltration</h2>
        <p>
            At precisely <strong>H+45 minutes (0315 hours)</strong>, the Indian Armed Forces initiated the final and most delicate phase of Operation Sindoor: 
            the coordinated extraction and exfiltration of all deployed personnel. Following the successful kinetic and cyber assaults, 
            maintaining stealth, safety, and speed became paramount.
        </p>

        <p>
            Across hostile terrain, <strong>Garud Commandos</strong> sprang into action to secure temporary Landing Zones (LZs), 
            deploying <strong>infrared strobes and laser beacons</strong> to guide <em>NVG-equipped</em> <strong>Mi-17V5 helicopters</strong> 
            from the elite <strong>109 Helicopter Unit</strong>. Each LZ was secured under tight defensive perimeters, 
            covered by <strong>MANPADS teams</strong> and sniper overwatch. Simultaneously, <strong>MARCOS teams</strong> operating 
            deep behind enemy lines began their covert maritime withdrawal toward rendezvous points along the Arabian Sea.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under the ocean’s veil, <strong>INS Shankul</strong> — an HDW-class submarine — silently surfaced to extract MARCOS divers, 
            while <strong>fast attack boats</strong> equipped with low-RCS hulls escorted remaining units through the narrow creeks and river mouths, 
            tracing a path from <strong>Sir Creek to the Gujarat coast</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overhead, the skies were alive with persistent surveillance. <strong>Heron Mk-II UAVs</strong> hovered quietly, 
            providing real-time <strong>ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance)</strong> and overwatch on troop movement and enemy positioning. 
            <strong>Netra AEW&C aircraft</strong> ensured early detection of any air threats, while <strong>Su-30MKIs equipped with EL/M-20600 EW pods</strong> 
            jammed enemy radar and communication signals throughout the corridor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last of the troops cleared the operational boundary by <strong>0433 hours</strong>. 
            With the final signal received from Command HQ, Phase 3 was officially marked as <strong>“COMPLETE”</strong>. 
            All <strong>124 special operations personnel</strong> returned to base safely — a testament to the flawless coordination, technological superiority, 
            and bravery of India’s elite forces.
