        <h2>Phase 2: Execution</h2>
        <p>
            At exactly <strong>02:30 hours on May 7, 2025</strong>, the Indian Armed Forces initiated the <em>Execution Phase</em> of Operation Sindoor ‚Äî 
            a swift, high-precision offensive meticulously crafted to neutralize critical enemy assets within a tightly synchronized time window.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky roared as <strong>Rafale multirole fighters</strong>, cruising at high altitudes near the border, launched deadly <strong>SCALP cruise missiles</strong> 
            with devastating precision, striking command hubs and strategic infrastructure. Within seconds, <strong>Mirage 2000 squadrons</strong> swooped in for follow-up attacks, 
            deploying <strong>SPICE-2000 precision-guided bombs</strong> on hardened bunkers and radar installations. High-value targets were destroyed with surgical efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simultaneously, the elite <strong>Cyber Warfare Division</strong> unleashed <strong>‚ÄúOperation Digital Storm‚Äù</strong> ‚Äî a digital blitzkrieg that crippled enemy radar, 
            blacked out communication grids, and spoofed GPS systems. This created a crucial <strong>17-minute window of complete electronic blindness</strong>, 
            ensuring zero interception threats for our aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the ground, <strong>special forces units</strong> covertly designated targets using laser markers, coordinated air-ground strikes in real time, 
            and assessed bomb damage to ensure mission success. Throughout the operation, advanced <strong>electronic warfare systems</strong> provided 
            a protective jamming shield, safeguarding all assets during both ingress and exfiltration.
        </p>
        <p>
            In just <strong>23 minutes</strong>, the kinetic strikes were complete. All aircraft returned safely to base, marking one of the most 
            coordinated, high-tempo operations in modern Indian military history.
