            As the dust settles from the kinetic operations, Phase 4 initiates a comprehensive <span class="highlight">strategic consolidation</span> 
            across all domains of engagement. The Indian Armed Forces, in coordination with the National Security Council, 
            are executing <span class="highlight">Operation Shakti Gathan</span> - a multi-dimensional campaign to institutionalize operational gains. 
            This phase sees the deployment of psychological operations units broadcasting victory messages on captured 
            frequencies, while cyber teams establish permanent monitoring infrastructure in formerly hostile networks. 
            Along the Line of Control, newly erected surveillance towers with <span class="highlight">AI-powered monitoring systems</span> create an 
            impenetrable electronic fence, reducing infiltration attempts by 87% compared to pre-operation levels. 
            Diplomatically, the Ministry of External Affairs is conducting <span class="highlight">"Backchannel Thunder"</span>, a series of covert 
            negotiations to formalize the new security paradigm. Meanwhile, the Defense Research and Development 
            Organization has begun analyzing captured equipment, with preliminary findings already enhancing our 
            counter-terrorism technological edge. The phase culminates with the establishment of <span class="highlight">Raksha Kavach</span> - a 
            permanent quick-reaction force posture that reduces response time to border incidents to under 9 minutes.
